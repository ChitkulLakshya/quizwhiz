## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lime green (#DAF7A6) to evoke a friendly and inviting feeling, reminiscent of the displayed 'Marine Marvels' game background, yet subtly distinctive.
- Background color: Pale yellow (#FAF9F6), creating a light scheme to improve readability.
- Accent color: Light purple (#E6E6FA) for a smooth contrast with the primary color; drawing inspiration from other parts of the reference image.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' sans-serif, aligning to the style of the design in the images you provided.
- Body font: 'Alegreya' serif for body text, since 'Belleza' works best in short amounts of text.
- Use flat design icons related to quizzes, timing, and leaderboards.
- Mobile-first, responsive design ensuring readability and interactivity on all devices. Keep all of the key actions (answer selection, next/previous question buttons, etc) within easy reach of the thumb.
